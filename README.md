## Contributing to This Site

2. Create your own branch _git checkout -b **mybranch**_
3. Apply your changes
4. Run `rake` to verify that the tests are passing
5. Submit a pull request

Documentation should use [Github-flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), but with explicit links.

We use [Kippt](https://kippt.com/) for collecting resources. The mainpage dynamically pulls in resources from kippt if it's configured. If you'd like to see the links, either sign up for kippt yourself and configure it (look at config/kippt.yml.example for reference), or ask one of the core members for the username/token information. If you don't know what this means, feel free to ask or ignore it all together!
