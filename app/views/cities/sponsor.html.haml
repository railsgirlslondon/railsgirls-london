        Running our workshops and weekly meetings requires certain things to be
        arranged, as well as incurring a number of extra costs. We rely on
        the generosity of our sponsors to provide us a venue and catering, or
        otherwise to cover the cost of making the experience memorable for our
        attendees.

      %dl
        %dt Venues and catering
        %dd Places to hold our workshops and meetings, food and drink for coaches and participants

        %dt Merchandise
        %dd Rails Girls branded swag bags, name badges, posters, balloons, stickers

        %dt Post-workshop support
        %dd Frequent sessions to help keep the momentum

      %p
        Without sponsorship, we would be unable to make as big an impact in the
        community, or even run our workshops and meetings at all. Sponsorships
        or contributions at any level are welcomed.

        == Another way to sponsor Rails Girls #{@city.name} is to provide the venue and
        catering for a future event. We currently run large Workshops, and small
        Weekly meetings, and the requirements for each differ.

      %p
        == If you're interested in doing this, please get in touch at
        #{mail_to @city.email}, and we'll be happy to arrange something.
