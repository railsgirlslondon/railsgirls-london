      Helping us with the workshop financially
    %p
      We rely on the generosity of our sponsors to provide us with a venue, catering and refreshments, while also covering the costs of making the whole experience memorable for our attendees. Without this, we would be unable to continue to make such a big impact in the community. Sponsorships and contributions at any level are most welcome. Please get in touch to find out more.
