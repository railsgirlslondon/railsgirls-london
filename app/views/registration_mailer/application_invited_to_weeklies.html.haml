      We would like to invite you to our first Rails Girls Weekly event!

    %p.lead{style: "font-size: 22px;"}
      Rails Girls Weeklies are a new Q&amp;A style session aimed at people who have previously attended a Rails Girls workshop, or had some experience with Ruby on Rails.

    %p.lead{style: "font-size: 22px;"}
      Coaches from the workshops will be around to answer any questions you have about Ruby and Rails, and even pair with you if you need some help! You'll also have the opportunity to catch up with your fellow Rails Girls peers.

    %p.lead{style: "font-size: 22px;"}
      Sessions will be held every Wednesday, and will run loosely between 6.30PM and 9.00PM. The first one will be held at:
